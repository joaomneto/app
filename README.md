## Usage

1. Install the app on your GitHub Repositories: [github.com/apps/wip](https://github.com/apps/wip)
2. If the WIP bot finds "wip", "work in progress" or "do not merge" (not case-sensitive) in
   1. The pull request title
   2. One of the pull request labels
   3. One of the pull request commit messages
3. If it finds "fixup!" or "squash!" (case-sensitive) at the beginning of
   the commit message (indicating that the commit [should be squashed into
   another commit](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase#git-rebase---autostash))
   it sets status of the request title to pending
4. If it doesn’t find the words anywhere, it will set status to success
